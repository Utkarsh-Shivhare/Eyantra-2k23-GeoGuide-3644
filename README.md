# GeoGuide - E-Yantra 2k23 Final Submission 🧭🤖

This repository contains the final solution for the **E-Yantra Robotics Competition 2023** project: **GeoGuide**, developed by Team ID: 3644. The project involved building an **autonomous robot** capable of navigating a grid-based map using **infrared sensors**, **computer vision**, and **shortest path algorithms**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
GeoGuide is an autonomous navigation system that:
- Detects and follows paths using **infrared sensors**
- Computes real-time **shortest path traversal** between dynamically assigned waypoints
- Executes tasks with 98% instruction accuracy and minimal latency
- Achieved **1st position** in two consecutive leaderboards with a **perfect score**

## 🧠 Key Features
- Line following and path tracing with calibrated IR sensors  
- Real-time shortest path planning and dynamic obstacle handling  
- Optimized instruction execution with fault tolerance  
- Wireless communication for instruction decoding and control  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**, **C/C++**
- **PyTorch** for ML-based vision tasks
- **Image Processing**, **GIS**, **Remote Sensing**
- **Embedded Systems** (IR sensors, motor drivers)
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** for pathfinding
